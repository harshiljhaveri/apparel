### Apparel
## A ConvNet Approach for instance segmentation, embeddings generation and classification of apparel images based on the popular DeepFashion 2 dataset
Instance Segmentation of image by Object Localisation + Classification:- It includes identification of boundaries of the objects at the detailed pixel level. To follow the region proposal step and the classification step

Embeddings Generation and retrieval of K-nearest neighbors from Database:- The representations computed by the encoder turn out to have the very convenient property that they can be compared using cosine distance and vice versa using a decoder

Classification of Apparel by Category and Style:- The data must be preprocessed before training the network. Building the model, setting up the layers, compiling and training the model
